We're excited to announce that Multikernel is officially open-sourcing our Linux kernel implementation. Our initial patches are now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/multikernel/linux/commits/multikernel-part-1/) and submitted for review on the [Linux Kernel Mailing List](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250918222607.186488-1-xiyou.wangcong@gmail.com/).

## Community-First Development

At Multikernel, we believe the most impactful systems innovations emerge from collaborative development. We're engaging with the Linux kernel community early in our process, ensuring our work benefits from collective expertise and contributes meaningfully to the broader Linux ecosystem.

## Building on Proven Foundations

Our multikernel architecture builds upon open research and existing Linux infrastructure, particularly the proven kexec subsystem. By leveraging kexec's battle-tested kernel switching capabilities, we implement spawned kernel functionality using well-understood mechanisms that have been part of Linux for over two decades.

This reflects our commitment to standing on the shoulders of giants. Rather than reinventing fundamental mechanisms, we're extending existing infrastructure validated by the community, ensuring robustness and compatibility.

## 100% Transparency

We're committed to complete transparency. All kernel modifications, architectural decisions, and implementation details are shared openly.

## Technical Deep Dives

Beyond open-sourcing our code, we're preparing a series of educational videos that will explain both our multikernel solution and the underlying Linux kexec infrastructure that makes it possible. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@multikernel-tech

## Looking Forward

This release begins what we hope will be ongoing collaboration with the Linux community. We're seeking feedback and partnerships with developers who share our vision of advancing OS architecture for cloud computing. We will be open sourcing more projects!
