        <h1>Multikernel System Design And Roadmap</h1>
        <p>Our comprehensive plan for revolutionizing cloud operating systems through multikernel architecture.</p>

            <i data-lucide="info"></i> Summary
        </div>
        <p class="roadmap-text">The Multikernel project introduces a novel Linux operating system architecture that runs multiple Linux kernel instances without relying on virtualization, each core or core group runs dedicated kernel instances independently. This approach addresses scalability limitations in traditional monolithic and microkernel designs while providing superior performance isolation, elastic resource allocation, and zero-downtime upgrades.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="roadmap-item">
        <div class="roadmap-section">
            <i data-lucide="compass"></i> 1. Design Philosophy
        </div>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Flexibility-First:</strong> The design aims to maximize the flexibility through programmable interfaces, leveraging eBPF extensively for dynamic behavior modification without kernel recompilation.</p>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Freedom of Choice:</strong> The design must preserve and respect users' choice, including enabling and disabling this feature, using this feature with all reasonable existing competitive solutions, like using SR-IOV or general virtualization on top.</p>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Simplicity and Minimalism:</strong> The design maintains architectural simplicity by avoiding complex abstraction layers that plague current virtualization stacks.</p>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Infrastructure Reuse:</strong> The design should leverage existing kernel subsystems wherever possible, including kexec for kernel loading, CPU/memory hotplug for resource management, existing driver frameworks for I/O, and standard eBPF infrastructure for programmability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="roadmap-item">
        <div class="roadmap-section">
            <i data-lucide="target"></i> 2. Target Use Cases
        </div>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>High-Performance Workload Isolation:</strong> Provides an alternative to containers and virtual machines with superior performance characteristics. Each application receives dedicated kernel instances with customized configurations, eliminating noisy neighbor effects while maintaining near-bare-metal performance.</p>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Kernel Customization and Specialization:</strong> Enables users to deploy application-specific kernel configurations through multiple mechanisms: eBPF programs for runtime behavior modification, specialized kernel modules for hardware optimization, and machine learning-driven parameter tuning for workload adaptation.</p>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Kernel-Level Fault Tolerance:</strong> Implements fault isolation where kernel instances can fail independently without affecting other instances or the host system. Failed instances can be transparently restarted or replaced while maintaining application availability.</p>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Zero-Downtime Kernel Upgrades:</strong> Supports seamless kernel updates by spawning new kernel instances with updated versions while gradually migrating workloads from old instances. This enables continuous system operation during security patches, feature updates, or configuration changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="roadmap-item">
        <div class="roadmap-section">
            <i data-lucide="map"></i> 3. Implementation Roadmap
        </div>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Kernel Loading Infrastructure Enhancement:</strong> Current Status: Basic kernel loading implemented using kexec. Objectives include migrating to C-based trampoline implementation, implementing kexec-unload-based shutdown mechanism, and adding support for kernel image verification and secure boot integration.</p>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Inter-Kernel Communication Infrastructure:</strong> Current Status: Basic IPI communication established with preliminary shared memory support. Objectives include developing comprehensive messaging protocol, establishing security boundaries, and creating foundation for resource management and upgrade protocols.</p>
        <p class="roadmap-text"><strong>Dynamic Hardware Resource Management:</strong> Current Status: Not implemented; depends on communication infrastructure completion. Objectives include CPU management with hotplug integration, memory management with RAM hotplug-based allocation, I/O resource management for dynamic device assignment, and comprehensive resource monitoring.</p>
